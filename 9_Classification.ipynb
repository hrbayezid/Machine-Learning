    "# Notes on Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification** is a supervised machine learning task where the goal is to predict the categorical label of new observations based on past observations with known labels.\n",
    "- The output variable in classification is **discrete** (e.g., spam/ham, disease/no disease, digit 0-9).\n",
    "- Common algorithms include:\n",
    "    - Logistic Regression\n",
    "    - Decision Trees\n",
    "    - Random Forests\n",
    "    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "    - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)\n",
    "    - **Evaluation metrics** for classification:  \n",
    "        - Accuracy  \n",
    "        - Precision, Recall, F1-score  \n",
    "        - Confusion Matrix (shows true/false positives/negatives for each class)  \n",
    "        - Log Loss (measures the uncertainty of predictions; lower is better)  \n",
    "        - ROC Curve and AUC\n",
    "- **Applications**:\n",
    "    - Email spam detection\n",
    "    - Image recognition\n",
    "    - Medical diagnosis\n",
    "    - Sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is fundamental in data science and is widely used in various domains to automate decision-making processes."
